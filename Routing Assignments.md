**Routing notifications** allow stakeholders to approve or reject the case outside of the application.
	If the **email approval** option is enabled, when the case reaches the approval step, the application sends an email to the user or users specified by the step routing.
	If the **mobile approval** is enabled, the application pushes an approval notification to a mobile device.
