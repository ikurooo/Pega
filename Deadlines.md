Unlike the **goal** and **deadline** intervals, you can configure the **passed deadline interval** to repeat a fixed number of times or until the user completes the Assignment. You can continue to increase the Assignment Urgency and send an escalation Action each time the passed deadline elapses.

## Urgency with the passed deadline interval

The maximum Urgency is 100. At an Urgency value of 100, PegaÂ ignores further Urgency adjustments and continues other escalation Actions.
